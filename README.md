# Motormenders-demosite
This is my first git Repositry.It's a college project on php.Created only with html5,css and php.<br><br>

"This is a basic project for MotorMenders, an automobile service center website where visitors can learn about the various services offered by the center. If someone is interested in scheduling an appointment, they can do so by filling out the appointment form available on the website. Additionally, there is an admin section where staff can view customer appointments and contact customers as needed."<br>

<h3>Steps to run this project on your pc</h3>
"First, you need to have XAMPP installed on your computer, which you can download from any web browser.<br><br>

After downloading the XAMPP application, start the XAMPP control panel and activate the Apache and MySQL modules.<br><br>

Next, download the 'motormenders' folder present in this repository and save the entire folder directly into the 'htdocs' directory within the XAMPP folder. The location of the XAMPP folder should be the same as where you saved your XAMPP installation files during the app installation process."<br><br>

<h4>How to save the sql file in the admin section</h4>
"When you open the 'motormenders' directory, you will find a .sql file. This file can be saved directly to the admin section to create your database.<br><br>

In the XAMPP control panel, select the admin part of the MySQL section. It will open in a new tab in your browser. Navigate to the 'export' section and import this file directly into your database."<br><br>

<h5>How to start the website</h5>
"Now, open a new tab in your web browser and in the address bar, type 'localhost/motormenders/'.<br><br>
